This is the gitHub repo for CSE110"# CSE110M260T2" 

Our team  will develop an app that lets the user know the most optimal time to leave our current position to catch the next closest available bus. 
This app would probably need access to the user¡¯s current geographical location, and also the bus (Whether it be UCSD shuttles or city buses) that the user is attempting to mount.
